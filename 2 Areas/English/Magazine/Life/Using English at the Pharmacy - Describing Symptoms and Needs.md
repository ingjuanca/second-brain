Using English at the Pharmacy: Describing Symptoms and Needs

Going to a pharmacy in an English-speaking country can feel difficult, but don’t worry! With a few simple words, you can explain your problem and get help quickly.

  

First, tell the pharmacist your symptoms — these are the signs of your illness. You can say:

“I have a headache.”

“My throat hurts.”

“I feel tired.”

“I have a cough and a runny nose.”

  

Next, tell the pharmacist what you need. You can ask:

“Do you have something for a cold?”

“Can I take this with food?”

“How many times should I take this?”

“Is this safe for children?”

  

Pharmacists are friendly and want to help. If you don’t understand, it’s OK to ask:

“Can you please repeat that?” or

“Can you speak more slowly?”

  

You don’t need to speak perfect English — just speak clearly and stay calm. With practice, it gets easier!

Let's check what you can remember!
