An announcement for everyone who feels restless sitting at the same desk day after day at work: your time having the same desk or office may be about to end! More and more companies are deciding to jump on the **bandwagon** by abandoning fixed seating and establishing 'hot-desking' policies in their workplaces.

No, this doesn’t mean having heated desks and seats during the winter! 'Hot-desking' – formally known as 'activity based working' – is a practice where all employees in a given department sit together in one open office, a space in which there are no assigned desks. If you’re the first one to get to work in the morning, this means that you have your choice of where to sit during the day. The main goal of '**hot-desking**' is to promote a professional culture of openness and collaboration. The idea is for all department members to be accessible to one another all day, every day. This includes managers and supervisors. Instead of being isolated from their teams, they will work with them side by side.

Many companies consider '**hot-desking**' a **cost-cutting** move. By doing away with separate spaces, cubicles, and partitions, offices are able to save a considerable amount of money. They may even be able to downsize to smaller **workplaces**, which lowers the cost of rent and other **cash-guzzling** **utilities**, such as electricity and heating and cooling.

Some of you are probably thinking that this seemingly chaotic arrangement will result in an atmosphere of general disarray. Not true! Studies have shown that when employees are given the chance to move around and sit in different areas, they become more and more productive and efficient. They save time by not having to walk back and forth to the manager’s office or to other employees. As work spaces become more communal, teams become tighter, companies save money, and more work gets done!
