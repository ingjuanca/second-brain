Hot-desking: the future?

  

An announcement for everyone who feels restless sitting at the same desk day after day at work: your time having the same desk or office may be about to end! **`More and more`** companies are deciding to jump on the bandwagon by abandoning fixed seating and establishing 'hot-desking' policies in their workplaces.

  

…

  

Some of you are probably thinking that this seemingly chaotic arrangement will result in an atmosphere of general disarray. Not true! Studies have shown that when employees are given the chance to move around and sit in different areas, they become **`more and more productive and efficient`**. They save time by not having to walk back and forth to the manager’s office or to other employees. As work spaces become more communal, teams become tighter, companies save money, and more work gets done!

Many companies consider 'hot-desking' a cost-cutting move. By doing away with separate spaces, cubicles, and partitions, offices are able to save a considerable amount of money. They may even be able to downsize to smaller workplaces, which lowers the cost of rent and other cash-guzzling utilities, such as electricity and heating and cooling.

1. More and more companies are deciding to jump on the bandwagon by abandoning fixed seating and establishing 'hot-desking' policies in their workplaces.
    

2. They may even be able to downsize to smaller workplaces, which lowers the cost of rent and other cash-guzzling utilities, such as electricity and heating and cooling.

That’s right!

The double comparative is often used to express a process of increasing change.

It can be used with verbs such as ‘become’, a continuous tense, or a simple tense when a change is being expressed.

  

More and more companies are deciding to jump on the bandwagon by abandoning fixed seating and establishing 'hot-desking' policies in their workplaces.

  

The single comparative does not always carry these meanings.
