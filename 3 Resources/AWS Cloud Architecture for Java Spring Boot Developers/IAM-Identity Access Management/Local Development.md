*** Resource *** - Local Development

Dear All,

In the following lecture, we would be using AWS CLI & S3 SDK to demonstrate how to access AWS services from local machine.

- AWS CLI - [Installation steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
    
- [AWS SDK Reference](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/#using-the-sdk)
    
- [Maven Dependencies](https://github.com/vinsguru/aws-cloud-architect-essentials/blob/main/iam/aws-cli-s3-sdk.md#maven-dependencies)
    

Thanks.
