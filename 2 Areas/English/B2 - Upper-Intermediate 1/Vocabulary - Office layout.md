*We have a **traditional office** arrangement. All of us work in separate areas, and the boss has his own office.*  

*Personally, I like having a **fixed seating** arrangement. I feel comfortable sitting at the same desk every day.*

*If I got that promotion, the first thing I’d ask for is a **corner office**. I would love to see the sun coming through all those windows!*

### Where does everyone work?

What is your workspace like?

I think that my workspace is rather typical. I don’t have my own office; instead, I work in a **cubicle** surrounded by all my colleagues. I have all the equipment I need – my laptop, telephone, and office supplies – right at my **workstation**. The **partitions** around my desk give me a sense of privacy. Luckily, I’m right next to the **watercooler**, so I don’t have to go too far to get a drink!

### Office Memo

As of the beginning of next quarter, HappiCo will implement two new policies regarding office arrangements. First, each department workspace will become an **open office**. The partitions separating employee cubicles will be taken down, so the work area will seem more **spacious** and not as cramped. Second, a **hot-desking** policy will take effect. From now on, there will be no fixed seating in any office in the building. Employees are now free to move to whichever desk they choose.
