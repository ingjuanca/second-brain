### How to Cultivate More Confidence in Your Career

---

Everyone wants to enjoy their work, and it's a no-brainer that hiring managers prefer confident candidates. However, we can easily become riddled with **self-doubt** and become unsure of our abilities. So, how can we develop more confidence?

The first step to confidence is to be **self-aware**. Make an honest evaluation without judgement. One confidence coach suggests starting with our communication style. How do others perceive us? What mannerisms do we have that we need to control and adapt? Knowing others see us as confident helps us feel confident.

Next, think of what work activities come easily to you. Which ones do you enjoy? Then, ask someone you trust to give you honest feedback. Finally, review your last performance assessment. A combination of these sources will provide a useful 'strengths' list to help incorporate tasks you know are your strong points. This will amp up your assurance when asked to do a new or difficult task. But what if your list is a little lacking? Continued development and education are crucial, we all need to keep learning. Setting specific goals helps us focus on needed skills.

The saying 'fake it till you make it' means that by imitating confidence, a person can realize those qualities in their real life and achieve the results they seek. Adopting the feeling of someone who is in control, who knows what they're doing, can train the mind to accept a new situation. This exercise can really pay off, and then you won't be faking confidence anymore!

4. Do you think others perceive you as confident? Why/why not?

5. Have you ever asked a colleague for honest feedback or has a colleague ever asked you? If so, do you think it was helpful?
