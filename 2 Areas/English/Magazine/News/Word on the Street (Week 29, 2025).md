### • Goldman Sachs Introduces AI Engineer Devin

In a bid to work faster, Goldman Sachs has added 'Devin', an AI-powered software engineer, to its team. Created by startup Cognition, Devin can handle coding tasks from start to finish and may help developers work three to four times faster. The bank plans to hire hundreds—or even thousands—of these AI agents alongside its 12,000 human engineers. Goldman's leaders believe a “hybrid workforce,” where people and AI work side by side, will create new roles for developers to guide and oversee these digital colleagues.
  

### • Try Yogurt on Windows to Cool Your Home

A professor at Loughborough University found a simple way to beat summer heat: smear Greek yogurt on your windows. In a month-long test with two identical houses, the one with yogurt on its windows stayed up to 6.3°F cooler on hot, sunny days. On average, it was still 1°F cooler. The yogurt’s thin film blocks some solar radiation, and it dries in under a minute with no lasting smell. Dr. Roberts says Greek yogurt with about 10% fat works best for this easy cooling hack.
